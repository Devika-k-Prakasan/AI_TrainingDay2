## AI Training Day 2 Projects
This repository contains hands-on computer vision projects developed during Day 2 of AI training. The projects demonstrate key techniques in image and video processing, including:
**Color Segmentation** — Isolating specific colors from live video using HSV thresholds.
**Hand Detection & Tracking** — Detecting and tracking hand gestures using contour detection.
**Invisibility Cloak Effect** — Creating an illusion of invisibility by replacing specific color regions with the background.
**Pose Estimation** — Estimating body keypoints using pre-trained models.

Built with **Python 3.8** and **OpenCV**, these projects provide practical insights into real-time computer vision and deep learning.
